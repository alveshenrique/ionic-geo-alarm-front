# An alarm that won't let you miss the buss stop anymore!
 This app is a tool that help people know when they are arriving at their destination.
 The concept is quite simple: You mark a destination and set a distance by which the alarm will alert you when you are at such distance from the set destination. This app uses the Google Maps API and tools to get the destinations places (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places), the gocoding (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview), and the distance using the current location and the destination's LAT/LNG (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geometry) while ploting the map positions of those entities on a map (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/google-maps).
